# 3D Scanner for ESP8266
This mini project shows an attempt to built a cheap areal 3D scanner. The two attempts use an ultrasonic transducer and a time-of-flight sensor.
The project ist Arduino based with the ESP8266 board extension.

For the time-of-flight sensor, the Adafruit_VL53L0X extension is used.

Configuration is marked in the code.

3D Models of the 3D printed parts can be found in the Models subfolder.
The blender file can be used to adjust the models if they don't fit.
